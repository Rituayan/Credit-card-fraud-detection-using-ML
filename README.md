Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python & Machine Learning

For any bank or financial organization, credit card fraud detection is of utmost importance. We have to spot potential fraud so that consumers can not bill for goods that they haven’t purchased. The aim is, therefore, to create a classifier that indicates whether a requested transaction is a fraud.


In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using machine numpy, scikit learn, and few other python libraries. The problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.

Credit Card Fraud Dataset
The dataset consists of 31 parameters. Due to confidentiality issues, 28 of the features are the result of the PCA transformation. “Time’ and “Amount” are the only aspects that were not modified with PCA.

There are a total of 284,807 transactions with only 492 of them being fraud. So, the label distribution suffers from imbalance issues.

Tools and Libraries used
We use the following libraries in credit card fraud detection project.

Python – 3.x
Numpy – 1.19.2
Scikit-learn – 0.24.1
Matplotlib – 3.3.4
Imblearn – 0.8.0
Collections, Itertools
